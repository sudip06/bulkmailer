-------------------------------------

[1] check inbox mode
	retrive input (three options : socks / proxy / ssh ) , this will set the method of verifying if the current socks / proxy / ssh sends the emails
	directly to inbox , by using imap and accessing the file in  test/1.txt , this file contains emails and their passwords in form of email:pass ,
	and by sending an email from the current  socks / proxy / ssh to the chosen email from test/1.txt , after the mail was sent , we will use imap and access
	the inbox and look for the subject of that mail , after we will the check the originating IP in the headers (X-ME-IP) if it is the same as the one of the chosen socks / proxy / ssh then we will add this IP to the whitelist file , otherwise put it in the blacklist file .

	
	----------------------------
	
[2] send mode

- socks4-5 / proxy / ssh
	Before we start sending we need to check if the current IP delivers the emails to inbox , by using imap and checking the originating IP header (XE-ME-IP)
	just in case if the user didnt input [1] check mode .
	We need to send 500 emails per SMTP
	After finishing the current 500 mails , we need to resend another mail to see  if the used IP delivers the emails to inbox again by using IMAP 
	and checking the originating IP header (XE-ME-IP) , if it still delivers mails inbox then we dont need to use a new socks4-5 / proxy / ssh and SMTP account .
